## Overview
Beep boop want to drive is a reincarnation of the classic game
[Snake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_(video_game_genre)), aiming to
bridge the gap between software and hardware in an engaging and entertaining
game. In beep boop want to drive, the user wirelessly steers a hardware car,
which they navigate around a game arena marked out in tape. There are several
dots placed in the arena and the user is directed to random dots in turn. The
user is provided 3 powerups, which they can use to cut the speed of the car in
half for 3 seconds, gaining a new powerup every 5 dots collected. Picking up a
dot increases the speed of the car up to maximum speed after 8 dots. The goal of
the game is to collect as many dots as possible without leaving the arena 3
times.

The game features a hardware, remote-controlled car, gesture recognition
steering, speech recognition game controls, and an overhead camera that uses
computer vision to track the game. A central laptop orchestrates the entire
game, seamlessly blending the disjoint modules together.

## How to Play

* Hold the IMU controller with the USB cable pointing away from you. Tilt it
  left and right to steer. The car will only turn by a set amount
* Use voice commands to control the game:
    * `game pause`: stop the car and pause the game
    * `continue`: continue the game from a paused state
    * `activate power`: use a powerup, slowing the car down for a limited time
* Drive over the dot outlined in purple on the GUI to pick it up
* Every dot will increase the car's speed, and every 5 will give a new powerup
* If the car leaves the arena, you lose a life and game is paused. Move the car
  back into the arena and say `continue` to continue the game

## Setup with Provided Hardware

### Game Arena

Take a white poster board and give it a border of black tape, leaving about a
1/2 inch gap between the tape and the edge of the poster board. Cut 4-5 squares
from a piece of black construction paper and tape them to the poster. Affix the
poster to the floor. Position the external camera directly over the poster such
that the entire poster is comfortably in view.

### Car

Make sure the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file is up to date with the wifi network and
password it will be using. Plug the power bank into the RPi and get its IP
address with

```
ping -4 raspberrypi.local
```

Then remotely `ssh` into the RPi and run the following:

```
conda activate controller
python Team5/hardware/mqtt_motor.py
```

### IMU

Make sure the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file is up to date with the wifi network and
password it will be using. Attach the IMU RPi to the computer and log into it
with a serial connection. The necessary script will start automatically. Press
Ctrl+C to stop the script after finishing the game. If you need to restart the
script, run the following commands:

    cd Team5/gesture/BerryIMU/python-BerryIMU-gyro-accel-compass-filters
    python berryIMU.py

### Game Controller

Set up the controller environment with the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/180D-FW-2021/Team5.git
cd Team5/controller
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate controller
```
Then, ensuring that the external webcam is attached to the computer and
functional, find the computer's device handle indices with

```
python start.py --show-devices
```

To determine which of the listed camera indices is the correct one, test them
with commands like

```
python start.py --test-camera --camera <INDEX>
```

After finding the correct camera and microphone indices, start the game with

```
python start.py --camera <INDEX> --microphone <INDEX>
```

## Detailed Setup
The game has 3 computers which all require different software running on them: the RPi with the IMU, the RPi on the car, and the controlling laptop. In total, you will need the following:

* Laptop (1)
* External webcam or smartphone (1)
  * If using a phone, you will need a camera mount to hold the phone over the game arena
* RaspberryPi Zero WH (2)
* BerryIMUv3 (1)
* 9V Battery
* 5V battery powerbank
* Hardware car
* White poster board
* Black paper
* Miscellaneous wires and connectors (Recommended to have ~8 Female-Male)

Note that the hardware car is not described in detail here. Currently we have no schematic of the car to share, but the car is based on an [L293 H-bridge](https://www.adafruit.com/product/807) and 2 9V DC motors, and an industrious user could investigate the code in the `hardware` directory to determine pin assignments on the RPi. Refer to the following info on how the Hâ€“Bridge works: [Direction Truth Table](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1n0UCoyRyvaSpgobGnBY8AHq8t6nLdRKh/view?usp=sharing), [H-Bridge Pinout](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1lcsleWE-I3sc4Y-wqP7EvscM3ZZQUWd-/view?usp=sharing).

### Arena
The arena has 3 main components: the boundary, the dots, and the car. These components are differentiated by their shape and color. The boundary is described by a black inset border on the poster, about a half inch from the edge, the dots are represented by solid black rectangles/squares, and the car is marked with a black circle. For the arena to be valid, there must be a white poster board with its black border, at least two dots, and the car fully within its bounds.

The arena is overseen by the external camera. This can be a standard webcam or a smartphone running [DroidCam](https://www.dev47apps.com/). Since this camera is likely not the default camera of the laptop, one will need to use the startup script described later to determine its device handle to ensure the game runs properly.

### Gesture RPi
These setup instructions are adapted from lab 4.
To setup the IMU controller, first connect the BerryIMU to the Raspberry Pi as shown:
![alt text](https://github.com/180D-FW-2021/Team5/blob/fda2e14a4b80961ee594399cf037b4bf1a368d94/gesture/Images/hw-setup.PNG)

Next, enter the following commands into the Raspberry Pi command line to install the necessary components:

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get upgrade
    conda upgrade conda
    conda update conda
    pip install --upgrade pip
    sudo apt-get install git i2c-tools libi2c-dev
    conda install -c conda-forge smbus2

Try opening the blacklist file `/etc/modprobe.d/raspi-blacklist.conf`. If the file contains the line `blacklist i2c-bcm2708`, place a '#' in front to comment it out. If the file is empty or can't be opened then continue.

Add the following lines into `/etc/modules`:

    i2c-dev
    i2c-bcm2708

Add the following lines into `/boot/config.txt`:

    dtparam=i2c_arm=on
    dtparam=i2c1=on

Reboot the RPi, then enter in the command line `sudo i2cdetect -y 1`. The following should be displayed:
![alt text](https://github.com/180D-FW-2021/Team5/blob/fda2e14a4b80961ee594399cf037b4bf1a368d94/gesture/Images/i2cdetect.PNG)

Next, run `git clone https://github.com/180D-FW-2021/Team5.git` to clone the repository. Run the following commands to navigate to and run the IMU controller code. Always run IMU controller code before running Car RPi code. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop running IMU controller code.

    cd Team5/gesture/BerryIMU/python-BerryIMU-gyro-accel-compass-filters
    python berryIMU.py

### Car RPi
The only set up needed for the Car RPi is to connect to the internet by modifying the `wpa_supplicant.conf` file. Once connected, run `ifconfig` to obtain the IP address under the `WLAN0: inet`. Then enter the settings to enable remote ssh.

Then connect the RPi to the powerbank, then remote ssh and clone the repo.

    ssh pi@<ip address>
    git clone https://github.com/180D-FW-2021/Team5.git
    
Then go to the `Team5/hardware` folder. You will need to modify the file to change any pin assignments and MQTT topics as needed. Note that `enL` and `enR` MUST be PWM pins (pins 12,13,18,19)

    nano mqtt_motor.py
        in1 = ...
        in2 = ...
        etc.
    
The virtual environment provided in `controller/environment.yml` has all necessary packages to run the car software. Follow the steps in the Controller Laptop section to create the same environment on the Car RPi. Then activate the environment and run the main code.
    
    conda activate controller
    python mqtt_motor.py

Since the `controller` environment contains many large packages that the car will never use, you can also create a simpler environment, including only the `paho-mqtt` package.

    conda create -n <envname> -c conda-forge paho-mqtt
    conda activate <envname>
    python mqtt_motor.py

1. If your car responds to messages that your controller did not send, make sure that you are not responding to other messages on the same mqtt topic. If this occurs, please change the topic on all MQTT programs. 
2. Note: you can modify the turning length of the car by editing the car.py file's left_turn_length and right_turn_length.
3. If you suddenly lose connection to the car, it is possible that the car left the range of the remote ssh. In this case, you will need to reconnect to the car and rerun the program. In the case that the motors are still running, press `Ctrl+C` to abort the program (this will cause the car to stop the motors) and you may restart the game as normal.

    
### Game Controller
(*This laptop needs a microphone in order to process speech inputs.*)

Follow the instructions in [Setup with Provided Hardware](#setup-with-provided-hardware).

The GUI will display information about the game parts it has parsed. The boundary will be outlined in blue, the dots will have green circles around them, and the car will be outlined in red. The target dot, the next dot the player should aim to get, will have an extra purple circle around it.

Running `start.py` may fail with an error about a license expiring. Because this project uses the free version of [Porcupine](https://picovoice.ai/platform/porcupine/), the speech recognition models eventually expire. If a user so desires, they could train a new model of the same keywords and place the model in `speech/porcupine_models`. The user would also have to change the file paths in [`controller/speechworker.py`](../controller/speechworker.py).
